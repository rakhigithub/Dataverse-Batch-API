Introduction

In the dynamic world of data-driven applications, optimizing interactions with APIs is paramount. Microsoft Dataverse, a robust data platform, offers a gateway to powerful data management. However, efficiency is the key. Batch requests, the unsung heroes of API optimization, allow bundling multiple operations into a single call. In this blog, we explore the transformative power of batch requests in Dataverse API. Discover how this technique minimizes network calls, enhances performance, and ensures data consistency.




Benefits of Using Batch Requests

Certainly! Batch requests in APIs offer several benefits, making them a powerful tool for optimizing data processing workflows. Here's a list of the key benefits of using batch requests:

Reduced Network Calls:Batch requests enable bundling multiple operations into a single HTTP request. This consolidation significantly reduces the number of network calls, minimizing latency and enhancing overall application responsiveness.

Improved Performance:By reducing the overhead associated with individual HTTP requests, batch requests enhance the performance of API interactions. Applications experience faster response times, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Optimized Resource Utilization:Fewer network calls mean optimized server and client resources. Servers handle fewer incoming requests, reducing processing load. Clients consume fewer network resources, conserving bandwidth and improving device battery life, especially in mobile applications.

Simplified Error Handling:Batch requests simplify error handling. If any operation within a batch fails, the entire batch is rolled back. This atomic nature makes it easier to manage errors and ensures data integrity.

Enhanced Scalability:Batch requests allow applications to efficiently process large volumes of data. By grouping operations, applications can scale more effectively, accommodating growing datasets without compromising performance.

Conservation of API Limits:Many APIs have rate limits or quotas on the number of requests a client can make within a specific timeframe. Batch requests help conserve these limits by minimizing the number of API calls, allowing applications to stay within their allowed usage boundaries.

Real-world Use Cases and Examples

Batch operations are quite helpful when we want to process large amount of CRUD operations.
One use case would be to add the Flow run history for all the environments in Dataverse table by reading JSONL file. These Jsonl files contains millions of records. Implementation of batch api is quite useful in this case.

Best Practices and Tips

Batch requests can contain up to 1000 individual requests and can't contain other batch requests
For Transactional data, changesets can be implemented which will allow the roll back of whole batch operation in a changeset in case of error.
Batch request are quite difficult to compose. Hence special attention should be given while generating the batch request body.
